Uploads are LumeCMS primitives to configure folders where upload, edit or remove
files. It allows to explore these files in the interface and even preview the
content.

To define an upload element in LumeCMS you need 2 things:

- The upload name. For example: "Images".
- The storage used to read and write the content.

Use the `cms.upload()` function to setup an upload folder:

```ts
cms.upload("images", "src:images");
```

In the example above, we have defined the `images` upload folder, pointing to
the `images` folder in the `src` storage.

You can include a short description that will be visible in the UI with the
format `name: description`. For example:

```ts
cms.upload(
  "images: Here you can manage all images of your posts",
  "src:images",
);
```
